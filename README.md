## Intro

(
    We refactored our application this year from AngularJS to React with TypeScript.

    Who is already using React?
    Who is still using AngularJS?
    Who uses Angular2,3,4? - poor souls

    One of the coolest things we learned in the process is how awesome it is to have types in your templates. And because with React and JSX/TSX your templates reside directly in the code itself you also get all the advantages of TypeScript in your "templates" as well.

## What are types good for anyway?

- Tooling (Autocomplete, Refactoring, etc)

- Code Comprehension 
(Definition of clear interfaces, expected inputs and outputs)

- Static type checking! Compile time errors
(Can catch some bugs, that are hard to catch for the human eye alone)
